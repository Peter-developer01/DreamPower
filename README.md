# DreamPower
The perfectest coding language. **Still working on it!**

When you're done reading through, check out the examples.

# Basics
Be bold! End every stement with an `!`.

```
let const name = "David"!
```

If you're feeling extra-bold, you can do this:

```
let const name = "David"!!!!!
```

In some languages, you use `!` for not. In DreamPower, you use `;`.

```
if (;loved) {
  print("I am so sad!")
}
```

# Variables

To declare constants, use `let const`.

```
let const name = "David"!
```

To declare variables, use `let var`.

```
let var name = "David"!
name = "Dave"!
```

# Booleans

Booleans can be `true`, `false`, or `maybe`.

# Matrices

In DreamPower, when it comes to lists, you use matrices instead of arrays. It's fairly simple:

```
let const myMatr = [1, 2, 3]!
print(myMatr)! // Matr[1, 2, 3]
```
